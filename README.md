# 🚀 Real-Time eCommerce Data Platform

> An end-to-end Real-Time Data Engineering project that simulates an eCommerce order processing platform using Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, PySpark, Delta Lake, and Databricks. The project follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to ingest, validate, transform, and analyze streaming order data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern eCommerce platforms generate thousands of customer orders every second. Processing this continuously arriving data requires a scalable, reliable, and fault-tolerant data pipeline.

This project demonstrates how a modern Lakehouse-based Data Engineering platform can be built using industry-standard tools.

The pipeline:

- Generates real-time order events
- Streams events through Apache Kafka
- Orchestrates ingestion using Apache Airflow
- Stores landing data as JSON
- Processes data using PySpark and Delta Lake
- Implements Medallion Architecture
- Performs data validation and deduplication
- Supports incremental loading using Delta MERGE
- Produces business-ready Gold layer analytics

# 🎯 Business Problem

An eCommerce company continuously receives customer orders throughout the day.

The business requires a scalable platform capable of:

- Processing streaming order events
- Decoupling producers and consumers
- Validating incoming data
- Removing duplicate events
- Supporting incremental processing
- Tracking pipeline execution metrics
- Producing business-ready analytical datasets

Traditional batch ETL pipelines are not suitable for continuously arriving events.

This project demonstrates an event-driven Lakehouse architecture that solves these challenges.

# 🏗️ Solution Architecture

The implemented solution follows an event-driven architecture.
